# kong-plugin-mtls-auth

**kong-plugin-mtls-auth** is an Open Source plugin for [Kong](https://github.com/Mashape/kong) which authenticates
clients using mTLS. It is similar (but simpler) than the [mTLS](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/mtls-auth/) plugin provided in Kong Enterprise edition.
      
Information extracted from the mTLS client certificate can be made available using headers for
the upstream service, or used by other plugins (such as the [kong-plugin-mtls-acl](https://github.com/yasazo/kong-plugin-mtls-acl) plugins)
to further limit access. 

The implementation of this plugin was inspired by the 
[mtls-validate](https://github.com/emersonqueiroz/kong-plugin-mtls-validate) plugin.

## Installation

If you're using `luarocks` execute the following:

    luarocks install kong-plugin-mtls-auth

You also need to set the `KONG_PLUGINS` environment variable

    export KONG_PLUGINS=mtls-auth

## Configuration

Configure nginx to use verify client certificate in `kong.conf`:

	nginx_proxy_ssl_client_certificate = /path/to/rootCA.crt
	nginx_proxy_ssl_verify_client = on
    
To enable the plugin only for one service:

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/{ID}/plugins \
        --data "name=mtls-auth"  \
        --data "config.upstream_cert_cn_header=X-Client-Cert-San"

To enable the plugin using declarative config in `kong.yml`:

    plugins: 
    - name: mtls-auth
      config:
        upstream_cert_cn_header: "X-Client-Cert-San"
